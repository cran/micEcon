THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "micEcon" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-6

* translogCheckMono() now automatically removes the coefficients of shifter
variables before it calls translogDeriv() so that it can be used also with
models that have shifter variables now


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-4

* removed argument "quadHalf" of many functions for econometric analysis
with the translog and quadratic functional form, because this argument
is confusing and not really helpful

* translogCheckMono() now can check whether a translog function is monotonically
decreasing in some explanatory variables and monotonically increasing in other
explanatory variables

* the "micEcon" package no longer *depends* on the "systemfit" package
but *suggests* it now



            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-2

* The "micEcon" package has been split into three packages again:
a) micEconSNQP (version >= 0.6-0): includes all functions and methods for production
   analysis with the Symmetric Normalized Profit (SNQ) function.
b) micEconCES (version >= 0.6-0): includes all functions and methods for economic
   analysis with the Constant Elasticity of Scale (CES) function.
c) micEcon (version >= 0.6-0): includes the remaining parts of the previous
   version of the micEcon package

* function ".micEconLogData" has been moved from the "micEcon" package
  to the "miscTools" package and was renamed as "logDataSet"


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-0

* The "micEcon" package has been split into three packages:
a) miscTools (version >= 0.6-0): includes miscellaneous small tools and
   utilities that are not related to (micro)economics, e.g. colMedians(),
   rowMedians(), insertCol(), insertRow(), vecli(), symMatrix(), triang(),
   semidefiniteness(), compPlot(), and rSquared().
b) micEconAids (version >= 0.6-0): includes all functions and methods for demand
   analysis with the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS).
c) micEcon (version >= 0.6-0): includes the remaining parts of the "old" micEcon
   package
