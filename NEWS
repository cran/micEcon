THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "micEcon" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-12  (2014-04-22)

* 'micEcon' no loger depends on package 'miscTools' but imports this package

* no panel data (e.g. cross-sectional data): fixed the returned 'model.matrix'
in the presence of categorical explanatory variables

* panel data: the returned object no longer includes the 'model.matrix'


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-10  (2012-06-02)

* internal change, not relevant for the user


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-8  (2012-06-01)

* separated tools for non-parametric microeconomic analysis into a new package 
micEconNP (currently only available via micEcon's RForge site)

* added data set "appleProdFr86"

* quadFuncEst() and translogEst() now return components "r2" and "r2bar" also 
when a panel data model was estimated by plm()

* if the data set is a panel data frame, quadFuncEst(), and hence, also 
translogEst(), should call plm() rather than lm() again (the class name of 
panel data frames has changed)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-6

* translogCheckMono() now automatically removes the coefficients of shifter
variables before it calls translogDeriv() so that it can be used also with
models that have shifter variables now


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-4

* removed argument "quadHalf" of many functions for econometric analysis
with the translog and quadratic functional form, because this argument
is confusing and not really helpful

* translogCheckMono() now can check whether a translog function is monotonically
decreasing in some explanatory variables and monotonically increasing in other
explanatory variables

* the "micEcon" package no longer *depends* on the "systemfit" package
but *suggests* it now



            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-2

* The "micEcon" package has been split into three packages again:
a) micEconSNQP (version >= 0.6-0): includes all functions and methods for production
   analysis with the Symmetric Normalized Profit (SNQ) function.
b) micEconCES (version >= 0.6-0): includes all functions and methods for economic
   analysis with the Constant Elasticity of Scale (CES) function.
c) micEcon (version >= 0.6-0): includes the remaining parts of the previous
   version of the micEcon package

* function ".micEconLogData" has been moved from the "micEcon" package
  to the "miscTools" package and was renamed as "logDataSet"


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-0

* The "micEcon" package has been split into three packages:
a) miscTools (version >= 0.6-0): includes miscellaneous small tools and
   utilities that are not related to (micro)economics, e.g. colMedians(),
   rowMedians(), insertCol(), insertRow(), vecli(), symMatrix(), triang(),
   semidefiniteness(), compPlot(), and rSquared().
b) micEconAids (version >= 0.6-0): includes all functions and methods for demand
   analysis with the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS).
c) micEcon (version >= 0.6-0): includes the remaining parts of the "old" micEcon
   package


            CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5-23 AND BEFORE
